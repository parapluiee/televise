A screensaver developed for my personal machine.

Uses MPV, sockets, bash and C, hooked onto my laptops Xorg engine (and BSPWM window manager) to automatically start "flipping channels" through my collection of films, halting on mouse movement. 
Very personalised to my laptop, and would take a lot of fiddling to make work even on another linux machine.
